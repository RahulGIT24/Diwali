            <p>Western India observes Diwali in a lavish manner each year. A few days before Diwali, the markets are
                crowded with shoppers as well as a lot of diyas, lamps, firecrackers, and other things. </p>
            <p>The evening before Diwali, Gujaratis decorate the fronts of their houses with colorful rangolis.
                Additionally, to welcome Goddess Laxmi, footprints are made. According to the Hindu calendar, Gujarat
                celebrates Diwali as the New Year. Some homes leave a ghee-lit diya burning all night. The following
                morning, women paint their eyes with kajal, which is made from the flame collected from this diya. This
                tradition is regarded as extremely auspicious and is thought to bring prosperity for the entire year.
                Gujarat, in particular, has a strong commercial and business presence. Diwali is regarded as a lucky day
                for starting new businesses, purchasing real estate, opening stores and offices, and celebrating
                important life milestones like weddings. </p>

                Diwali is celebrated for four days in Maharashtra. The first day, Vasubaras, is honored by having a cow
                and calf Aarti performed. This represents the affection a mother has for her child. The following day is
                Dhanteras or Dhanatrayodashi, observed similarly to other cultures. The third day, Narakchaturdashi, is
                when people visit temples and take scented oil baths early in the morning. Following this,
                Maharashtrians feast on a special Diwali preparation that includes delectable sweets like karanji and
                ladoo as well as spicy eatables like chakli and sev. This feast is known as “Faral.” Lakshmi Puja is
                performed on the fourth day, which is the main Diwali day. Goddess Lakshmi and wealth-related items such
                as money and jewelry are worshiped in every home.</p>
