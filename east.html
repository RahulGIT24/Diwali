            <p>In Eastern India, essential Diwali rituals include the lighting of lamps, candles, and diyas, along with
                the artful creation of rangolis and the delightful consumption of sweets. As a customary practice,
                people often leave their doors unlocked, welcoming Goddess Lakshmi into their homes. This tradition
                stems from the belief that Goddess Lakshmi doesn't enter a dark house, hence the importance of keeping
                homes brilliantly illuminated throughout the festival.</p>
            <p>In West Bengal, Laxmi Puja follows Durga Puja by six days. On Diwali night, Goddess Kali is revered well
                into the early hours, and numerous Kali Puja pandals can be found across the region. While other
                traditions remain unchanged, rangoli patterns continue to be a significant part of the celebration.
                Diwali night is also known as Pitripurush, the night dedicated to honoring ancestors. To aid the
                departed on their journey to heaven, diyas are lit atop tall poles. Similarly, in Odisha, Diwali
                celebrations include paying tribute to ancestors by burning jute sticks to attract good fortune and
                blessings.</p>

                Diwali's vibrant hues blend with the spiritual and natural surroundings of our Northeastern states to
                create the Tihar Festival, a variant of the festival of lights.</p>

            <p>It is a celebration honoring the wonders of nature, the abundance of the natural world, the need for
                flora and fauna for food, and, among all of that, the long history of human civilization. The states of
                Sikkim, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Assam, and some regions of Northern Bengal and Nepal are where the Tihar
                festival is widely observed. During the five-day Kaag Tihar celebrations, prayers are offered to all the
                creatures—including birds, dogs, cows, and even the wild ones—and plants that appear in our mythology.

            <p>On the first day, sweets are distributed to the crows. They believe that the crow is a symbol of sadness
                and grief and that it brings bad news to a family. A family can avoid sadness in their lives by feeding
                them sweets. On the second day, which is known locally as Kukkad Tihar, dogs are worshipped and fed a
                variety of delectables. In mythology, dogs hold a special place and have long served as humans' obedient
                companions. They are fed meat and fish, as well as worshipped with garlands. Gai Tihar marks the start
                of the third day. Cows, buffaloes, and bulls are worshiped with garlands, "panchadeep," tika,
                vegetables, and sacred threads. Laxmi Puja is also performed on this day by a large number of families.
                As night falls, earthen lamps, candles, and other lights cover the entire Northeast's rooftops. The most
                alluring scene is when the tribes sing the Deusi and Bhailo folk songs, which describe Lord Rama's
                suffering and Lord Hanumana's glory, in front of the fireworks. The last two days of Tihar celebrations
                are dedicated to Govardhan Puja and Bhai Tika, the Northeast's version of Bhai Dooj.</p>
